# Gaze UI &diamond; React Component Library

[Gaze](https://github.com/studio-drishti/gaze) is a free and open React design system built for [Studio Drishti](https://studiodrishti.co) projects that is heavily inspired by [Chakra UI](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Mantine](https://mantine.dev/). It is built upon the concepts outlined in [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/) and is best implemented with composition principles.

## Getting Started

It is necessary to install both the `@gaze-ui` `react` and `tokens` packages.

```bash
npm install --save @gaze-ui/react @gaze-ui/tokens
```

### Customizing

Many theme properties may be customized by setting custom CSS property in the `:root` space. For example...

```css
:root {
  --gaze-font-family-base: "Papyrus", fantasy;
}
```

## Contributing

While Gaze was built for Studio Drishti projects, it is open source and welcome to contributions.
